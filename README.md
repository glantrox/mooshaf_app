# 📖 · Kajeean App
Kajeean App is a powerful application designed to manage Ustadz's religious lectures. As a developer, I have integrated several advanced features into this app to ensure that it serves its intended purpose effectively. One of the standout features that I have added is the ability to assign or cancel lectures with ease. This function is incredibly useful as it enables Ustadz to plan their schedule efficiently while ensuring that attendees are informed of any changes promptly.

The application caters to two distinct types of users - Ustadz and attendees. Ustadz plays a pivotal role in managing the lectures, while attendees have the opportunity to join and participate in these religious events. Each user has access to an interactive platform where they can add their comments and engage in lively discussions with other attendees or the Ustadz. This feature enhances the learning experience for all participants, allowing them to exchange ideas, pose questions, and clarify any doubts they may have.

In addition to the commenting feature, Ustadz can also add a livestreaming video link before uploading the lecture. This functionality makes it possible for attendees who are unable to attend the event physically to still participate remotely. They can follow along with the lecture in real-time, ask questions, and engage in discussions, just like the attendees who are physically present. This feature enhances accessibility and allows for broader participation, regardless of the attendee's location.

Overall, Kajeean App is an incredibly useful tool for managing Ustadz's religious lectures. Its advanced features make it easy for Ustadz to manage their lectures, and for attendees to participate in these events, regardless of their location. With this app, learning about religion has become more engaging and accessible to everyone.
